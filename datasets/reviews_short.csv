Plus, I\'m a petite person, and I get frustrated with multipacks like these, because the largest tampon I can use is the regular size, so most of the tampons go to waste.  If you\'re petite, definitely don\'t get these.  If you\'re not, be sure to buy a whole bunch of lubricant to go with them.  I used them for years, but didn\'t know what I was missing: plastic tampons!  I recommend Kotex--much less of a pain, literally."

I have used Tampax for years and have never had any pain or health problems from their usage, and I will continue to use them till I no longer have a need for them.  Not only that, but the price for a box of 100 is excellent."

What I\'m reviewing is the true luxury and convenience of shopping at Amazon.com!  I\'m super busy working full-time and being pulled in many different directions - as I\'m sure many are - so ordering this type of product online has been wonderful.  It sure beats sending the hubby to the store and getting the mystery box when he returns!"
